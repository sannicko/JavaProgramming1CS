Note: In all of the exercises, assume that instance variables are private.
Question # 2) Implement and test a class Employee. An employee has a first name (String), 
a last name (String) and a salary (double). A method raiseSalary and a method printEmployee 
will be implemented. The method raiseSalary will raise an employee salary by the amount 
passed to the method as an argument value.
Add a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a toString method to the class Employee.
