Note: In all of the exercises, assume that instance variables are private.
Question # 3) Write a program that defines and tests a class Rectangle. 
In the class, there must be methods to calculate the area, to calculate the perimeter, 
and to print the information of the rectangle. Choose appropriately the instance variable(s) 
for this real-world object and add a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, 
and a toString method.
