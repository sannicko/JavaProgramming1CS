Note: In all of the exercises, assume that instance variables are private.
Question # 1) Write a program that defines and tests a class Square. In the class, 
there must be a method to find the area of the square and a method to print the 
information of the Square object. Choose appropriately the instance variable(s) 
for this real-world object and add a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, 
and a toString method.
