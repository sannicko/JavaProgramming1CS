Note: In all of the exercises, assume that instance variables are private.
Question # 2) Implement and test a class Employee. An employee has a first name (String), 
a last name (String) and a salary (double). A method raiseSalary and a method printEmployee 
will be implemented. The method raiseSalary will raise an employee salary by the amount 
passed to the method as an argument value. Sample usage of the class Employee:
Employee john = new Employee(); //initial salary = 30,000 
for example john.raiseSalary(2000); //new value of salary will be 32,000
