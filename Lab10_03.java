Question # 3) Write a rectangleArea, squareArea, and circleArea methods that 
calculate and print the area of a rectangle, a square, and a circle, respectively. 
These methods will have the following signature:
public void rectangleArea(double h, double w)
(h and w are the height and width of the rectangle, respectively)
public void squareArea(double s) (s is the length of the side of the square)
public void circleArea(double r) (r is the radius of the circle)

        squareArea(2);

    public void squareArea(double s) {
        System.out.println("The square area is: " + Math.pow(s, 2));
